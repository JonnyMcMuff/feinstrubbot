# setting up your own feinstrubbot

## prerequisite
First Install docker on your machine. For further instructions check out the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).</br>

Get a GoogleAPI token. See this [Google API Key Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for further information. </br>

Get a Telegram Bot token. See the [Telegram Bot Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for further information. </br>

## setup

After installing Docker clone the repository by using</br>
`git clone https://github.com/JonnyMcMuff/feinstrubbot.git`</br>
Change your directory</br>
`cd feinstrubbot`</br>
Insert your GoogleAPI token in a file named `google.token` and your Telegram token into a file named `bot.token` and place them both into the `DockerEnvironment/pythonBuild/scripts` directory.</br>
Bring up the Docker-Stack by changing your current directory to `DockerEnvironment`. Then execute:</br>
`docker-compose up`</br>

Afterwards you can use your bot the same way you would use the original feinstrubbot. You only need to specify the name of your bot when your start a new chat. You can refer to your bot by using `@[YOUR_BOT_NAME]`
